### Python cyber Security

Run using Python 3.7 with, cryptography 2.8 and pycryptodome 3.9.0 installed
The virtual environment has been included and is located in the 'env/' folder

Run 'main.py' for a live demo of AES CBC (cryptography), Xor and Caesar ciphers  
(once your done it will show a lil demo of AES CTR (pycryptodome) )

To run all Test in unittest Run 'encryption_test.py'  
To run each cipher individual test run: 
 
'test/aes_cryptodome_test.py' for AES CTR (pycryptodome)  
'test/aes_cryptography_test.py' for AES CBC (cryptography)  
'test/xor_test.py' for Xor  
'test/ceasar_test.py' for Caesar  

------

The code for all encryptions can be located in 'Encryptions/' folder    
'aes_cryptodome.py' for AES CTR (pycryptodome)    
'aes_cryptography.py' for AES CBC (cryptography)       
'ceasar.py' for Caesar                     
'xor.py' Xor
